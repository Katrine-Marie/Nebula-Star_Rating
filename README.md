# Nebula-Star_Rating

A simple Wordpress star rating plugin. Insert a star rating with a shortcode.

## Usage

You insert the `[nebula-rating]` shortcode into a post or page to display the rating.
The default rating value is 3 (out of 5), but you can change it by adding the `number` attribute to the shortcode, like so: `[nebula-rating number=5]`. Use a number between 1 and 5.

## Result
Here you can see what the resulting rating will look like:
