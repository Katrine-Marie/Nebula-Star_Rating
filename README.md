# Nebula-Star_Rating

A simple Wordpress star rating plugin. Insert a star rating with a shortcode.


## Usage

You insert the `[nebula-rating]` shortcode into a post or page to display the rating. The default rating value is 3 (out of 5), but you can change it by adding the `number` attribute to the shortcode, like so: `[nebula-rating number=5]`.
